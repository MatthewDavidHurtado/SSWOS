            <span className="font-semibold text-white">Witness God's allness.</span> To the best of your ability, witness perfection between God, His manifestation (man), and the harmonious relationship between them. Man is the image and likeness of God. Have only one God and one man. This tunes you into the Divine Mind.

Infinite patience produces immediate results. Patience is not a human quality; it is an admittance of a Divine Truth: that Principle (Love) is governing the situation entirely, not "you," nor anyone else.
